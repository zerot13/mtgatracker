# Privacy Policy

MTGATracker's core contributors ("us", "we", "our") manage source code ("the code"), distribute the
application ("the app") and operate and maintain MTGATracker.com ("the site"). This document serves
to inform users of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data we receive from users of
the app, the site, or contributors to the code.

**MTGATracker tracks and stores game data from MTG Arena.** (We hope this does not come as a surprise to our users,
based on the name of the project.) You can read more specifics about the data we
track [below](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/blob/master/legal/privacy.md#specifically-what-data-does-mtgatracker-track-and-how-often), as well as
learn how to [opt-out](https://github.com/shawkinsl/mtga-tracker/blob/master/legal/privacy.md#how-do-i-opt-out-turning-on-incognito-mode).

We are required, per [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) terms, to share a privacy policy.
None of us are lawyers; this is a document written by non-lawyer humans as a courtesy, and to satisfy Privacy Policy laws to the
best of our ability wherever applicable.

## Updates to this policy

MTGATracker is always getting better with new features & bug fixes. As MTGATracker evolves, this policy is
also subject to change with it, at any time. Notice of updates to this document may be provided to you via
notifications within MTGATracker. You may also see a live history of this file at any time by visiting the
following [link](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/commits/master/legal/privacy.md).

## Definitions

### Personally Identifiable Information

Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is a term used in legal documents such as the EU General Data Protection
Regulation ("GDPR"). In the case of GDPR, it refers to information that can be used to identify an individual
(i.e. by real name or home address, etc).

The legal nature of if the data collected with MTGATracker is considered PII is ambiguous; we do not legally consider
any of the information MTGATracker collects to be PII, as none of this information
can lead back to an identifiable individual (i.e. your real name or home address, etc) by use of our data sources alone.
**However,** we will endeavor anyways to protect information from
any category listed below as if it were. We will always ask for your consent before
sharing information from any category listed below with any party for any reason other than to
directly provide MTGATracker's services as outlined in our Terms of Service. For example, we will not
share information from any category below with marketing partners without your consent to do so.

### Linkable information

"Linkable Information" includes data that reasonably could be tied to a user, but does not inherently do so. We
consider things like anonymized IP Addresses, Unique Identity Codes from Identity Providers, Preferred Usernames
from Identity Providers (e.g. Twitch or Discord usernames), data about browsers,
country-of-origin, etc. to be "Linkable information," but not "Individual Person Information,"
or "Platform Information." In general, we prefer to anonymize Linkable information whenever possible.

### Individual Person Information

"Individual Person Information" includes data that de-facto represents an individual. We consider things
like email addresses, full names, phone numbers, and mailing addresses to be "Individual Person Information." **We
do not process, collect, store, or share any Individual Person Information.**

### Secure Information

"Secure Information" includes secret and private data such as passwords. We provide a service that is
[passwordless](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/blob/master/logging_in.md#mtga-tracker-is-passwordless),
and as such, we do not process, collect, store, or share any secure information.

### Platform Information

"Platform Information" includes data that represents an individual's persona & play history in MTGA. We consider things
like MTGA usernames, deck titles, deck contents, win/loss ratios, etc to be "Platform Information."
We consider Platform Information to be adjacent to and distinct from Individual Person Information,
similar to Linkable Information.

If a user chooses to encode Individual Person Information into platform information (for example, a user
providing a title for a deck that is also their home address), this use case would be a bizarre misuse of the
platform, in which MTGATracker is not liable. Encoding Individual Person Information into platform information
is done so at the user's own risk, and we are not responsible or liable to protect this data as such if you
choose to do so.

## Our data policy

### Legal Basis

While we do not consider any information MTGATracker collects to be Individual Person Information, our legal
basis for processing & storing any data that may be considered PII (namely, MTGA Usernames), now or in the future is and will always be
to fulfill the contract of providing MTGA Game Data Analysis to individual users, as outlined in the MTGATracker
[Terms of Services](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/commits/master/legal/tos.md),
per GDPR Article 6(1)(b).

While you must agree to our Terms of Services in order to use MTGATracker services,
your agreement to the Terms of Services contract _is not_ considered consent for your
information to be used for marketing purposes, or any other purpose than to directly carry out our contract with you.
Before using your information for any purposes outside of fulfilling the contract outlined in our Terms of Services,
we will ask for your consent. We ask for "soft-consent" and point you to this document from our downloads page only as a courtesy,
as well as to notify you of your ability to opt-out of our data processing, collection, and storage entirely.

### What we do and don't do with your data

We will never sell any of your information to any third parties. Ever.

If we ever do use Individual Person Information or PII, we will do so only to operate and improve the app and the site.
We must use third parties to process information from any of the definitions above, but we will we never
display Linkable Information (e.g. your Twitch / Discord username) publicly to any user other than the owner of
that information without that user's specific and express permission.
We also will never share your information with any 3rd party without
your express permission for any reason other than to operate the app and site. Again, we do not process,
collect, store, or share Individual Person Information, but if we ever do, we will not share it with or
sell it to any third party without your freely-given consent.

We do share anonymized IP Addresses sent to the site with analytics services
(namely, Google Analytics, which you can read more about [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)).
We only share this information to understand our usage history, understand the
scaling challenges ahead, plan future solutions, and generally to improve
the app and site. Note that we do not collect or store IP Addresses in any form, and we do not
share any Individual Person Information or PII with Google Analytics--not even your entire IP address.

We reserve the right to share raw data from any category with individuals affiliated with MTGATracker for the
purpose of fulfilling MTGATracker's contract outlined in our Terms. These individuals will always have signed
non-disclosure agreements on file.

We may share Platform Information with other services with your express permission for each service & 
use case, each of which, if any at all, will be outlined later in this document.

We reserve the right to share anonymous aggregate data publicly. We will endeavor to anonymize Platform
Information before sharing it publicly, but we reserve the right to
share Platform Information in its raw form with any authenticated user with a need to see that
information (for example, if you played a game against User A, it is reasonable that that game's data, alongside your
in-game username, will also be visible to User A.) We will not, without your permission, share specifics of your
platform information publicly. For example, we will not share the contents of a specific deck, your deck's name,
or your username publicly- if you think you have found a case where this is occurring,
[please report it to us](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#responsible-disclosure)
immediately.

Here are some examples of information we will **not** share without permission:

- User Gemma1234 has played 200 games with Merfolk!
- User James9876 has a playset of Belzenlok's!
- User xXxJ4CExXx has 27 decks, all of which are blue!
- User SPIKEBEST has won 3,000 games!
- User SPIKEBEST who has won 3,000 games this month is Twitch user iheartdwaynetherockjohnson
- Somewhere between one and nine anonymous users are running this exact decklist!

Here are some examples of information **we do** reserve the right to share publicly:

- 10+ anonymous users are running this exact decklist!
- The most rats used in any deck tracked with MTGATracker is 55, by an anonymous user.
- The largest land count ever used in a deck in MTGATracker is 40, by an anonymous user running a green deck. The smallest is 2, by an anonymous user running a red deck.
- The highest winrate of any user is 200:6, by an anonymous user.
- 43% of all blue-green decks tracked contain at least these 30 cards: ...
- 15% of users use or have used at least one profanity in the names of their decks.
- Zetalpha, Primal Dawn has been used in 98% of all decks tracked with MTGATracker!
- No one has ever used Sphinx's Decree in any game tracked by MTGATracker, ever!


## Specifically, what data does MTGATracker collect, and how often?

_Last updated with version 4.1.3_

### Linkable Information

When you sign in to MTGATracker: Inspector using an identity provider such as Twitch or Discord,
we always request the smallest set of information and permissions as possible.

We only collect this information to give you a method to uniquely authenticate with the Inspector service
without the need to create a new username / password. We do not share this information with any third parties
for marketing purposes or any other purposes, except sharing with the originating source while performing authentication (
for example, if you authenticate using Twitch, we will send Twitch and only Twitch your access code to ensure you
are authorized to represent your account on Twitch.)

#### Twitch and Discord

For Twitch and Discord, this set of information is:

- A Unique ID Number assigned to you by the identity provider
- Your preferred username in the service
- An API "access code," "access token," and "refresh token" (all of which only allows us to verify with the ID provider that you are authorized to represent that identity, and that only--we don't request any other actionable permissions from either service)

### Game Information

MTGATracker sends one request to our servers at the end of each game played with the tracker running, and one request
whenever your rank changes.

The following is an example payload sent to our server at the end of a game **with incognito mode enabled**:

```
{
  "anonymousUserID": "<hash>",  /* this is a hash (numeric representation) of your MTGA username */
  "date": "2018-05-08 14:40:26.809448"
}
```

In this case, no user entry will be generated.

The following is an example payload sent to our server at the end of a game 
**without incognito mode enabled.** Some fields have been
partially obscured, the opponent's name has been redacted, and the opponent's deck has been replaced with the 
partial contents of one of Spencatro's decks, but the record is otherwise real:

```

When incognito mode is enabled, no requests are sent when rank changes are observed in MTGATracker.

The following is an example payload sent to our server when a rankChange event is observed
**without incognito mode enabled.**

```
{
   "playerId": "...R3D4CT3D...",
   "newTier": 1,
   "oldTier": 1,
   "newClass": "Silver",
   "oldClass": "Silver",

   "oldStreak": 0,
   "rankUpdateType": "Constructed",
   "block_title": "Rank.Updated",
   "block_title_sequence": "398"
}
```

When incognito mode is enabled, no requests are sent when inventory changes (gold, gems, or vault progress)
are observed in MTGATracker.

MTGATracker sends a request to our servers when it detects a change in a user's inventory. The following is an example
payload sent to our servers on an inventory change event **without incognito mode enabled.**

```
{
    "type": "gold",
    "value": 20175,
    "playerId": "...R3D4CT3D...",
}

```

When incognito mode is enabled, no requests are sent when draft picks are observed in MTGATracker.

MTGATracker sends a request to our servers when a draft pick is observed. The following is an example
payload sent to our servers on an draft pick event **without incognito mode enabled.**

```
{
    "playerID": "...R3D4CT3D...",
    "pickNumber": 1,
    "packNumber": 0,
    "pack": [
        67916,
        68078,
        67972,
        67844,
        67928,

        68154,
        68182
    ],
    "pick": 68182
},
```

### User information

The following is what MTGATracker stores for each user record, created the first time a user
completes a game with the tracker running:

 "publicName": "Fearless_Inquisitor",
 "username": "Spencatro"}
```
